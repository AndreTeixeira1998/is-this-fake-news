## Running the Research Notebooks

The research notebooks (`/research-notebooks`) were developed on Kaggle, using the [Fake and real news dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset/code). 

To run these yourself:

- Sign into Kaggle.com
- Visit one of the links below to view the noteboook
    - [Multi-layer perceptron](https://www.kaggle.com/danielvegamyhre/fake-vs-real-news)
    - [BERT Fine-tuning](https://www.kaggle.com/danielvegamyhre/classifying-fake-news-with-bert)
- Click the "Copy and edit" button at the top-right (which will launch a Kaggle notebook instance containing this code with the dataset ready to go)
- Run the notebook (*Warning*: running these notebooks takes a long time due to the amount of computation required for the data pre-processing and training loop)
