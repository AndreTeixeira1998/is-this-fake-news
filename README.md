## Running the Research Notebooks

The research notebooks (`/research-notebooks`) were developed on Kaggle, using the (https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset/code)[Fake and real news dataset]. To run these yourself:
    - Sign into Kaggle.com
    - Visit one of the links below to view the noteboook
        - (https://www.kaggle.com/danielvegamyhre/fake-vs-real-news)(Multi-layer perceptron)
        - (https://www.kaggle.com/danielvegamyhre/classifying-fake-news-with-bert)[BERT Fine-tuning]
    - Click the "Copy and edit" button at the top-right (which will launch a Kaggle notebook instance containing this code with the dataset ready to go)
    - Run the notebook (*Warning*: running these notebooks takes a long time due to the amount of computation required for the data pre-processing and training loop)
